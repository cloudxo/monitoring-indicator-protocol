# Indicator Protocol

Tooling for teams to define and expose performance, scaling, and service level indicators.

There are 3 main uses cases for this project: Generating documentation, validating against an actual deployment's data, 
and keeping a registry of indicators (ideally running in a bosh deployment) for use in monitoring tools.

See [the wiki](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/indicators/wiki/Home) for more detailed information and documentation.
