# Indicator Protocol

This is an **observability as code** project which allows developers to define and expose performance, scaling, and service level indicators for monitoring and alerting.

There are 3 main uses cases for this project: Generating documentation, validating against an actual deployment's data, 
and keeping a registry of indicators for use in monitoring tools (e.g. prometheus alert manager, grafana).

See [the wiki](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/indicators/wiki/Home) for more detailed information and documentation.
